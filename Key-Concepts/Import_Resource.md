Got it — you want to **import** an existing Azure Storage Account into Terraform so Terraform can manage it, right? Here’s the **simple, step-by-step** process:

---

### 1. Make sure your Terraform code defines the storage account
Before importing, Terraform needs a matching resource block. Example:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "yourstorageaccountname"
  resource_group_name      = "your-resource-group"
  location                 = "your-location"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

You can leave most fields for now — after importing, you’ll run `terraform plan` to sync everything properly.

---

### 2. Run the `terraform import` command
The basic syntax is:

```bash
terraform import azurerm_storage_account.example /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}
```

**Example:**

```bash
terraform import azurerm_storage_account.example /subscriptions/12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678/resourceGroups/my-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount
```

---
   
### 3. After import
- Run `terraform plan` to see the current state compared to your config.
- Update your `.tf` file to match any attributes that Terraform expects.
- (Optional) Run `terraform state show azurerm_storage_account.example` to view all imported properties.

---

**Quick tip:**  
If your `.tf` config doesn't match exactly, Terraform will want to recreate things. So after import, tweak your `.tf` files until `terraform plan` shows **no changes**.
